**Assignment of week 2:**  
>Optimize the codes of week one's project£º  

1. Utilize `switch` in the judgement of user input.
2. If `5` input, use `break` to exit the loop.
3. Use `try-catch` to handle the exception of input which is not `0` to `5`, and then print error messages.
4. Rewrite each processing method for input to single function and declare it in header file. Consider whether it can be implemented inline and called by the loop in the main function.
5. If you find other ways in these chapters to optimize the codes, describe in the report detailly.
